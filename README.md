An External Mod Manager for Balatro that makes it easy to browse, install, and update mods.

This mod utilizes github links to pull information, download, and update Balatro mods. 
These links will be stored in a text file made on this github but will also be easily editable if the community wants to make external lists. Of course you can always make requests to add links here too!

Currently this is in production, but this repo will be (hopefully) in a week or so be updated to include some early functional builds for testing and use.
