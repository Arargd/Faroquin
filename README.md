An External Mod Manager for Balatro that makes it easy to browse, install, and update mods.

This mod utilizes github links to pull information, download, and update Balatro mods. 
These links will be stored in a text file made on this github but will also be easily editable if the community wants to make external lists. Of course you can always make requests to add links here too!
More information on the current modlist can be found [Here](https://github.com/Arargd/Faroquin/wiki/ModList)

Currently this program is in development, but there is a [Beta Release](https://github.com/Arargd/Faroquin/releases) you can actively play around with now. 

Please add any contributions or issues you have as it would be greatly helpful!
